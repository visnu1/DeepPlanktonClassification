# DeepPlanktonClassification

# Classification Project

This project performs image classification using deep learning techniques in PyTorch. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project uses a deep learning model to classify images into different categories. The project is implemented in Python using PyTorch, along with several libraries for data processing and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and preprocesses images.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes pre-trained models from PyTorch for transfer learning.
- **Training**: Trains the model on the dataset with a custom or pre-trained model.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Installation
